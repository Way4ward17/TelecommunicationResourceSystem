<img src="banner.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli"><br><br>
                             Telecommunications facilities in Nigeria were first established in 1886 by the colonial administration. These were geared towards discharging administrative functions rather than the provision of socio-economic development of the country. Accordingly, the introduction of public telegraph services linking Lagos by submarine cable along the west coast of Africa to Ghana, Sierra-Leone, Gambia and on to England was a greater priority than a robust telecommunications network.
							The total number of telephone lines at independence in 1960 was only 18,724 for a population estimated at about 40 million people. This translated to a teledensity of about 0.5 telephone lines per 1,000 people. The telephone network consisted of 121 exchanges of which 116 were of the manual (magneto) type and only 5 were automatic. Since independence, there have been a number of development plans for the expansionand modernisation of the telecommunications networks and services. Most of these plans were not fully implemented.
							Between 1960 and 1985, the telecommunications sector consisted of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T) in charge of the internal network and a limited liability company, the Nigerian External Telecommunications (NET) Limited, responsible for the external telecommunications services. NET provided the gateway to the outside world. Telecommunications development during this period was characterized by serious short- falls between planned targets and their realization, principally because of
							poor management, lack of accountability and transparency and low level of executive capacity.

							<br><br>


							The installed switching capacity at the end of 1985 was about 200, 000 lines as against the planned target of about 460,000. All the exchanges were analogue. Telephone penetration remained poor equal to telephone line to 440 inhabitants, well below the target of telephone line to 100 inhabitants recommended by ITU for developing countries. The quality of service was largely unsatisfactory. The telephone was unreliable, congested, expensive and customer unfriendly.
							Arising from the foregoing, in January 1985, the erstwhile Posts and Telecommunications Department was split into Postal and Telecommunications Divisions. The latter was merged with NET to form Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), a limited liability company, while the Postal Division was reconstituted into another organisation called the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST). The main objective of establishing NITEL was to harmonize the planning and co-ordination of the internal and external telecommunications services, rationalize investments in telecommunications development and provide accessible, efficient and affordable services.





							<h3>Present Status of the Telecommunications Industry</h3>


							There has been a modest development in the telecommunications industry since the inception of NITEL in 1985. Today, Nigeria has a public network of about 700,000 Lines capacity out of which 400,000 lines are connected. Nigeria therefore lags behind comparable and even less endowed African countries, let alone advanced countries. The process of deregulating the industry was initiated to tackle these observed sho rtcomings. This began with the establishment of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) by Decree 75 of 1992 whose main objectives include:
							

							<ul>
								
								<li> Creating a regulatory environment to facilitate the supply of telecommunications services and facilities</li>
							<li>Facilitating the entry of private entrepreneurs into the telecommunications market</li>
							<li>Promoting fair competition and efficient market conduct among all players in the industry.</li>
						</ul>
							<br>
							Since the inauguration of NCC in July 1993, it has set out guidelines for private sector participation and issued licenses to a number of companies for the following telecommunications undertakings:
						
							<br>
							<ul>
							<li>Installation and operation of public switched telephony;</li>
							<li>Installation of terminal or other equipment;</li>
							<li>Provision and operation of public payphones;</li>
							<li>Provision and operation of private network links employing cable, radio
							communications, or satellite within Nigeria;</li>
							<li>Provision and operation of public mobile communications;</li>
							<li>Provision and operation of telephones;</li>
							<li>Provision and operation of value-added network services;</li>
							<li>Repair and maintenance of telecommunications facilities; and</li>
							<li>Cabling</li>

							</ul>
							

							<h3>Telecommunications Services offered in Nigeria</h3>
							A wide range of services, as listed below, are now available:

<li>Establishing and enforcing technical operational standards and practices for all
operators including the imposition of penalties for violations. o Ensuring that the public interest is protected.


</ul>

<h4>Access Provider</h4><br>

<h5>Cellular Mobile Service Providers</h5><br>


A Cellular Mobile Service Provider (CMSP) shall be permitted to provide mobile services including the capability to carry its own long distance traffic within the area it operates.<br><br>
A CMSP will be required to interconnect with other service providers including other CMSPs. A CMSP shall be free to provide, in its service area, all types of mobile service including voice and non-voice messages, and using equipment compliant with relevant ITU standards.<br><br>
Local, Area, Regional and National licenses for Cellular Mobile Service Providers will be permitted and regulated by the NCC. An issued specific license can be upgraded to a wider area status by NCC based on appropriate criteria.<br><br>


<h5>Fixed Service Providers</h5>


The Fixed Service Providers (FSP) shall be permitted to establish the “last mile” linkages and switched services to provide end-user access services and carry local and long distance traffic within their service area without additional licensing. The FSP shall be free to provide, in their respective service areas, all types of fixed services including voice and non- voice messages, utilizing equipment compliant with relevant ITU standards.<br><br>

Local, Area, Regional and National licenses will be permitted and regulated by the NCC. An issued specific license can be upgraded to a wider area status by NCC based on appropriate criteria.<br><br>


<h5>Cable Service Providers</h5><br>
The Cable Service Provider (CSP) shall be permitted under relevant NBC/NCC legislation to provide cable-related services. CSPs shall be permitted to provide the “last mile” linkages and switched services within the ir service areas. They shall operate media services, which are essentially one-way entertainment-related services and may also be licensed to provide two way communication services, as local access providers. Direct interconnectivity between CSPs and other type of service providers in their areas of operation shall be required.<br>

Local, Area, Regional and National Licenses will be permitted and regulated by the NCC. An issued specific license can be upgraded to a wider area status by NCC based on appropriate criteria.<br>

<br><br>



<h4>Laws on information and communications technology in Nigeria</h4><br>

<h5>The Wireless Telegraphy Act3</h5><br>

The Wireless Telegraphy Act (WTA) was initially enacted in 1961. Having preceded all other extant laws in the sector, the WTA nevertheless continues to provide clarity in relation to the nature of the regulatory management of communications in Nigeria. Essentially, the Act seeks to regulate the licensing, location and operation of wireless telegraphy4 services in Nigeria. Under the Act, it is an offence for a person to establish or use any station for wireless telegraphy, or install or use apparatus for wireless telegraphy except in accordance with a licence issued by the Commission.5 In this regard, the "Commission" is defined to mean the Nigerian Communications Commission (with regard to telecommunications matters) and the National Broadcasting Commission (with regard to broadcasting matters).
<br><br>

<h5>The Nigerian Communications Act7</h5><br>


The Act was enacted in 2003 to create a regulatory framework for the Nigerian communications industry.8 The Act established the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) as an independent National Regulatory Authority (NRA) for the telecommunications industry in Nigeria.9 The Act further created provisions for the licensing and operations of telecommunications service providers and other related matters.10 Ten years after the enactment of the Act, it remains doubtful that the regulator has discovered and effectively utilised the sector-specific regulatory powers conferred on it under the legislation.

<br><br>
<h5>The National Broadcasting Commission Act12</h5><br>


The Act was first promulgated as a Decree on 24 August 1992. However, the Decree and its amendments have been adopted as an Act of the National Assembly. The National Broadcasting Commission Act therefore regulates radio broadcasting activities in Nigeria, as well as the licensing of Cable, DTH and all terrestrial radio and television services. It aims to implement the National Mass Communication Policy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and also sets standards with regards to the contents and quality of materials being broadcast over the country's radio waves.13 Though a critical component in convergence, neither the law nor the institution appear interested in regulatory convergence14 in the manner that technology has made it possible for broadcasting, internet and phone calls to occur through the use of one piece of equipment, such as a computer or a mobile phone.
<br><br>

<h5>The National Film and Video Censors Board Act15</h5><br>
 

The National Film Video Censors Board Act was enacted in 1993. The Act established the National Film Video Censors Board as a regulatory body to regulate the films and video industry in Nigeria. The Board is empowered by law to censor, approve and classify all films and videos whether imported or produced locally.16 It is also the duty of the Board to register all films and video outlets across the country and to keep a register of such registered outlets.17 Over the years, the NFVCB has operated without interfacing with either the National Broadcasting Commission or the Nigeria Communications Commission. The separate institutional and operational focus of the ICT sector agencies leaves many practices potentially harmful to consumers unsanctioned.

<br><br>

<h4>Telecommunication Regulations</h4>

Consistent with Section 70 of the Nigerian Communications Act 2003 (NCA 2003), the Commission is empowered to make and publish regulations on matters such as, but not limited to; written authorisations, permits, assignments and licences granted or issued under the NCA 2003; the assignment of rights to spectrum or numbers; communications related offences and penalties; any fees, charges, rates or fines to be imposed; a system of universal service provision; Quality of Service (QoS) standards; and any other matters as are necessary to enforce the provisions of the NCA 2003.

                            <p clas ="lead text-muted">


                        Telecommunication software is a vital component of all telecommunications network. Telecommunication software middleware can help diverts networks communicate with each other. For example, MS explorer.<br><br>

Functions of telecommunications software: the telecommunication software package provides a variety of communication support services. There are some functions of telecommunication software. These are as follows;<br><br>

     <h1>A. Access control:</h1> This function establishes the connection between terminal and computer in a network. The software works with a communication processor (such as a modem) to connect and disconnect communication links and establish communication parameter.<br>

    Access control is a method of guaranteeing that users are who they say they are and that they have the appropriate access to  data. At a high level, access control is a selective restriction of access to data. <br><br>


There are two types of access control: physical and logical. Physical access control limits access to campuses, buildings, rooms and physical IT assets. Logical access control limits connections to computer networks, system files and data.<br><br>

To secure a facility, organizations use electronic access control systems that rely on user credentials, access card readers, auditing and reports to track employee access to restricted business locations and proprietary areas, such as data centers. Some of these systems incorporate access control panels to restrict entry to rooms and buildings, as well as alarms and lockdown capabilities, to prevent unauthorized access or operations.<br><br>

Access control systems perform identification authentication and authorization of users and entities by evaluating required login credentials that can include passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), biometric scans, security tokens or other authentication factors. Multifactor authentication (MFA), which requires two or more authentication factors, is often an important part of a layered defense to protect access control systems.<br><br>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">Why is access control important?</span><br><br>


The goal of access control is to minimize the security risk of unauthorized access to physical and logical systems. Access control is a fundamental component of security compliance programs that ensures security technology and access control policies are in place to protect confidential information, such as customer data. Most organizations have infrastructure and procedures that limit access to networks, computer systems, applications, files and sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and intellectual property.<br><br>

Access control systems are complex and can be challenging to manage in dynamic IT environments that involve on-premises systems and cloud services. After some high-profile breaches, technology vendors have shifted away from single sign-on (SSO) systems to unified access management, which offers access controls for on-premises and cloud environments.<br><br>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">How access control works</span><br><br>

These security controls work by identifying an individual or entity, verifying that the person or application is who or what it claims to be, and authorizing the access level and set of actions associated with the username or Internet Protocol (IP) address. Directory services and protocols, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), provide access controls for authenticating and authorizing users and entities and enabling them to connect to computer resources, such as distributed applications and web servers.

Organizations use different access control models depending on their compliance requirements and the security levels of information technology (IT) they are trying to protect.









<br><br>
    <h1>B. Transmission control /TCP:</h1>  This function allows computers and terminals to send receive ; commands, message data, and program.<br><br>
    

    TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.<br><br>

TCP is one of the basic standards that define the rules of the internet and is included within the standards defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It is one of the most commonly used protocols within digital network communications and ensures end-to-end data delivery.<br><br>

TCP organizes data so that it can be transmitted between a server and a client. It guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over a network. Before it transmits data, TCP establishes a connection between a source and its destination, which it ensures remains live until communication begins. It then breaks large amounts of data into smaller packets, while ensuring data integrity is in place throughout the process.<br><br>


The two protocols working in transport layer are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). It is a connection-oriented and reliable protocol. The fact that TCP is connected means that computers must log in to each other without communication and communicate their communication rules at the same time. As an analogy to this issue we can give a phone call. When we talk on the phone, we start talking immediately. First of all, both sides say "Hello", then talk starts. If the communication is secure, it means that the other party sends us a message that it has received the data.<br><br>
Since it is reliable, there is no need to worry about the fate of the submitted data. Because TCP does not allow the loss of the data through a number of error detection and correction mechanisms.<br><br>
TCP splits the data coming from the upper layer into segments of a certain length so that the data can be transcoded. To receive these segments in the correct order on the receiving side, each segment is assigned a sequence number. Thus, packets that are lost during data transfer, are not received in the wrong order, or are received in the wrong order will not be a problem. In addition, the recipient computer on the other side has to send an acknowledged packet (ACK) meaning "okay, I got it fully" for the packets it receives. Whether the sender is the same as the sending computer is calculated by some kind of algorithm. If the algorithm results are the same on both sides, the data is sent without corruption. If the receiving computer does not receive the ACK packet within a certain period of time, it sends the packet again.<br><br>
Control of the data stream is provided by a mechanism called "sliding windows". The computer that sends the data does not expect an ACK bit from the opposite party for each segment it sends. They send out a certain number of segments collectively, waiting for a confirmation for this number they send. A certain number of this segment is called a window. The receiving computer's TCP layer sends information to the sending computer's TCP layer, meaning "my window size does not send that much." The window size shows the amount of data the computer can receive once. The sender computer has to send as much data as this amount of data. This is called "sliding windows" because the window size can change with mutual agreement during communication.<br><br>

<h2>What is IP?</h2>

The Internet Protocol (IP) is the method for sending data from one device to another across the internet. Every device has an IP address that uniquely identifies it and enables it to communicate with and exchange data with other devices connected to the internet.<br><br>

IP is responsible for defining how applications and devices exchange packets of data with each other. It is the principal communications protocol responsible for the formats and rules for exchanging data and messages between computers on a single network or several internet-connected networks. It does this through the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), a group of communications protocols that are split into four abstraction layers.<br><br>

IP is the main protocol within the internet layer of the TCP/IP. Its main purpose is to deliver data packets between the source application or device and the destination using methods and structures that place tags, such as address information, within data packets.<br><br>




<h4>How Does TCP/IP Work?</h4>

The TCP/IP model is the default method of data communication on the Internet.  It was developed by the United States Department of Defense to enable the accurate and correct transmission of data between devices. It breaks messages into packets to avoid having to resend the entire message in case it encounters a problem during transmission. Packets are automatically reassembled once they reach their destination. Every packet can take a different route between the source and the destination computer, depending on whether the original route used becomes congested or unavailable.<br><br>

TCP/IP divides communication tasks into layers that keep the process standardized, without hardware and software providers doing the management themselves. The data packets must pass through four layers before they are received by the destination device, then TCP/IP goes through the layers in reverse order to put the message back into its original format. <br><br>

As a connection based protocol, the TCP establishes and maintains a connection between applications or devices until they finish exchanging data. It determines how the original message should be broken into packets, numbers and reassembles the packets, and sends them on to other devices on the network, such as routers, security gateways, and switches, then on to their destination. TCP also sends and receives packets from the network layer, handles the transmission of any dropped packets, manages flow control, and ensures all packets reach their destination.<br><br>

A good example of how this works in practice is when an email is sent using SMTP from an email server. To start the process, the TCP layer in the server divides the message into packets, numbers them, and forwards them to the IP layer, which then transports each packet to the destination email server. When packets arrive, they are handed back to the TCP layer to be reassembled into the original message format and handed back to the email server, which delivers the message to a user’s email inbox.<br><br>

TCP/IP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection between a device and a server, which ensures multiple TCP socket connections can be transferred in both directions concurrently. Both the device and server must synchronize and acknowledge packets before communication begins, then they can negotiate, separate, and transfer TCP socket connections.<br><br>







<h1>C. Network management:</h1>
     This function messages communication in a telecommunication network.<br><br>

     <img src="manage.PNG" alt="Italian Trulli"><br><br>

     Network management is the process of administering and managing computer networks. Services provided by this discipline include fault analysis, performance management, provisioning of networks and maintaining quality of service. Network management software is used by network administrators to help perform these functions.<br><br>
    




	<span style="font-weight:bold;">How does a network management system do its job?</span><br><br>

	The system manages network devices such as switches, routers, access points, and wireless controllers. It typically uses a centralized server to collect data from network elements. The server can be located on-premises, in a private data center, or in the cloud.<br><br>

	Devices, clients, and applications on the network can send data to the server with updates about their status. Network administrators can monitor network operations by logging in to the server, usually through a web browser or a smartphone app.<br><br>
	<span style="font-weight:bold;">How do network elements send data to the system?</span><br><br>

	Networking devices, such as routers and switches, and network endpoints, such as computers, smartphones, cameras, machines, and sensors, typically send data to the system in one of two ways:<br><br>

    SNMP: The Simple Network Management Protocol is an open standard and has been the de facto network management protocol since the early 1990s. It is widely supported by most manufacturers of network elements. The network management system uses SNMP to "poll" each element in the network. Each element then sends a response to the system.
    Telemetry: A software agent installed in a network element allows for the automatic transmission of key performance indicators in real time. Telemetry is rapidly replacing SNMP, because it is more efficient, can produce many more data points, and is more scalable. And telemetry standards, such as NETCONF/YANG, are gaining traction as ways to offer the same multivendor support as SNMP.<br><br>




<h1>D. Error control:</h1>
     This function involves the detection and correction of transmission errors. Errors are usually caused by distortion in the communication channel, such as line noise and power surges.<br><br>




	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Error Control (Data Communications and Networking)</span><br><br>

Before learning the control mechanisms that can be implemented to protect a network from errors, you should realize that there are human errors and network errors. Human errors, such as a mistake in typing a number, usually are controlled through the application program. Network errors, such as those that occur during transmission, are controlled by the network hardware and software.<br><br>

There are two categories of network errors: corrupted data (data that have been changed) and lost data. Networks should be designed to (1) prevent, (2) detect, and (3) correct both corrupted data and lost data. We begin by examining the sources of errors and how to prevent them and then turn to error detection and correction.<br><br>

Network errors are a fact of life in data communications networks. Depending on the type of circuit, they may occur every few hours, minutes, or seconds because of noise on the lines. No network can eliminate all errors, but most errors can be prevented, detected, and corrected by proper design. IXCs that provide data transmission circuits provide statistical measures specifying typical error rates and the pattern of errors that can be expected on the circuits they lease. For example, the error rate might be stated as 1 in 500,000, meaning there is 1 bit in error for every 500,000 bits transmitted.<br><br>

Normally, errors appear in bursts. In a burst error, more than 1 data bit is changed by the error-causing condition. In other words, errors are not uniformly distributed in time. Although an error rate might be stated as 1 in 500,000, errors are more likely to occur as 100 bits every 50,000,000 bits. The fact that errors tend to be clustered in bursts rather than evenly dispersed is both good and bad. If the errors were not clustered, an error rate of 1 bit in 500,000 would make it rare for 2 erroneous bits to occur in the same character. Consequently, simple character-checking schemes would be effective at detecting errors.But burst errors are the rule rather than the exception, often obliterating 100 or more bits at a time. This makes it more difficult to recover the meaning, so more reliance must be placed on error detection and correction methods. The positive side is that there are long periods of error-free transmission, meaning that very few messages encounter errors. <br><br>
    


<span style="font-weight:bold;">Sources of Errors</span>

Line noise and distortion can cause data communication errors. The focus in this section is on electrical media such as twisted-pair wire and coaxial cable, because they are more likely to suffer from noise than are optical media such as fiber-optic cable. In this case, noise is undesirable electrical signals (for fiber-optic cable, it is undesirable light). Noise is introduced by equipment or natural disturbances, and it degrades the performance of a communication circuit. Noise manifests itself as extra bits, missing bits, or bits that have been "flipped" (i.e., changed from 1 to 0 or vice versa). Table below summarizes the major sources of error and ways to prevent them. The first six sources listed there are the most important; the last three are more common in analog rather than digital circuits.<br><br>

Line outages are a catastrophic cause of errors and incomplete transmission. Occasionally, a communication circuit fails for a brief period. This type of failure may be caused by faulty telephone end office equipment, storms, loss of the carrier signal, and any other failure that causes a short circuit. The most common cause of line outages are storms that cause damage to circuits or facilities.<br><br>

White noise or Gaussian noise (the familiar background hiss or static on radios and telephones) is caused by the thermal agitation of electrons and therefore is inescapable. <br><br>

<h1>E. Security management:</h1>
     This function protects a communication network from unauthorized access. Network operating system or other security program restricts access to data files and other computing resources in LANs and other types of networks.<br><br>


In developing any kind of security framework, it is very important to have a clear understanding of the requirements. A comprehensive review of security requirements must take into account: the parties involved; the assets that need to be protected; the threats against which those assets must be protected; the vulnerabilities associated with the assets and the environment; and the overall risk to the assets from those threats and vulnerabilities.<br><br>

This section introduces the basic requirements for protection of ICT applications, services and information, looks at the threats and vulnerabilities that drive the requirements, examines the role of standards in meeting the requirements, and identifies some of the features that are needed to protect the various parties involved in the use and operation of ICT facilities.<br><br>

Security requirements are both generic and context-specific. In addition, some requirements are well- established while others continue to evolve with new applications and the evolving threat environment. For the most part, the discussion in this section is generic. Requirements for particular applications and environments are discussed in later sections.<br><br>






<span style="font-weight:bold;">Threats, risks and vulnerabilities</span><br><br>
In general terms, there is a need to protect assets for:
<ul>
<li>customers/subscribers who need confidence in the network and the services offered, including availability of services (especially emergency services);
<li>public community/authorities who demand security by directives and/or legislation, in order to ensure availability of services, privacy protection, and fair competition; and
<li>network operators and service providers who need security to safeguard their operation and business interests and to meet their obligations to customers, their business partners and the public.
</ul>
The assets to be protected include:
<ul>
<li>communication and computing services;
<li>information and data, including software and data relating to security services;
<li>personnel; and
<li>equipment and facilities.
</ul>
A security threat is defined as a potential violation of security. Examples of threats include:
<ul>
<li>unauthorized disclosure of information;
<li>unauthorized destruction or modification of data, equipment or other resources;
<li>theft, removal or loss of information or other resources;
<li>interruption or denial of services; and
<li>impersonation, or masquerading as an authorized entity.

</ul>
Threats may be accidental (also sometimes called inadvertent) or intentional and may be active or passive. An accidental threat is one with no premeditated intent such as a system or software malfunction or a physical failure. An intentional threat is one that is realized by someone committing a deliberate act. Intentional threats may range from casual examination, using easily-available monitoring tools, to sophisticated attacks using special system knowledge. When an intentional threat is realized it is called an attack. An active threat is one that results in some change to the state or operation of a system, such as alteration of data or destruction of physical equipment. A passive threat involves no change of state. Eavesdropping and wiretapping are examples of passive threats.<br><br>




A security vulnerability is a flaw or weakness that could be exploited to violate a system or the information it contains. If a vulnerability exists, then it is possible for a threat to be realized successfully unless effective countermeasures are in place.
ITU-T Recommendations recognize four types of vulnerability:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>threat model vulnerabilities, which result from failure to foresee possible future threats;
<li>design and specification vulnerabilities, which result from errors or oversights in the design of a system or protocol and make it inherently vulnerable;
<li>implementation vulnerabilities, which are introduced by errors or oversights during system or protocol implementation; and
<li>operation and configuration vulnerabilities, which originate from improper usage of options in implementations or weak deployment policies and practices (such as failure to use encryption in a wireless network).

</ul>
Security risk is a measure of the adverse effects that can result if a security vulnerability is exploited, i.e., if a threat is realized. While risk can never be eliminated, one objective of security is to reduce risk to an acceptable level. In order to do that, it is necessary to understand the applicable threats and vulnerabilities and to apply appropriate countermeasures. These are usually specific security services and mechanisms which may be complemented by non-technical measures such as physical and personnel security.<br><br>
While threats and threat agents change, security vulnerabilities exist throughout the life of a system or protocol, unless specific steps are taken to address them. With standardized protocols being very widely-used, vulnerabilities associated with the protocols can have very serious implications and be global in scale. Hence, it is particularly important to understand and identify vulnerabilities in protocols and to take steps to eliminate them as and when they are identified.<br><br>
Standards bodies have both a responsibility and a unique ability to address security vulnerabilities that may be inherent in specifications such as architectures, frameworks and protocols. Even with adequate knowledge about the threats, risks and vulnerabilities associated with information processing and communications networks, adequate security cannot be achieved unless security measures are systematically applied in accordance with relevant security policies. The security policies themselves must be reviewed and updated periodically. Also, adequate provision must be made for security management and incident response. This will include assigning responsibility and specifying action that must be taken to prevent, detect, investigate and respond to any security incident.<br><br>
Security services and mechanisms can protect telecommunication networks against malicious attacks such as denial of service, eavesdropping, spoofing, tampering with messages (modification, delay, deletion, insertion, replay, re-routing, misrouting, or re-ordering of messages), repudiation or forgery. Protection techniques include prevention, detection and recovery from attacks, as well as management of security-related information. Protection must include measures to prevent service outages due to natural events (such as storms and earthquakes) and malicious attacks (deliberate or violent actions). Provisions must also be made to facilitate interception and monitoring by duly-authorized legal authorities.<br><br>
Telecommunication network security also demands extensive cooperation between service providers. Recommendation ITU-T E.408 provides an overview of security requirements and a framework that identifies security threats to telecommunication networks in general (both fixed and mobile; voice and data) and gives guidance for planning countermeasures that can be taken to mitigate the risks arising from the threats. Implementing the requirements of ITU-T E.408 would facilitate international cooperation in the following areas relating to telecommunication network security:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>information sharing and dissemination;
<li>incident coordination and crisis response;
<li>recruitment and training of security professionals;
<li>law enforcement coordination;
<li>protection of critical infrastructure and critical services; and
<li>development of appropriate legislation.
</ul>

Telecom companies have become the bedrock for many businesses to recover in 2021. They can help us live, work, and do business more effectively using advanced wireless technologies (e.g., 5G), edge computing, IoT, and more.<br><br>

                        
<h3>Top 10 Telecommunication Industry Trends in 2021</h3><br><br>
<h4>1. Internet of Things</h4><br><br>

IoT devices and sensors influence almost all industries of the technology economy. It improves people’s quality of life, allows businesses to increase their profits, and improves management. IoT is also beneficial for governments looking to decrease their information technology (IT)-related expenses. Interconnection between devices, sensors, infrastructure, and computing elements further enables new ways for management. For example, decentralized operations, condition-based monitoring, and predictive maintenance ensure efficient communications between various IoT devices. In this way, IoT automates production processes and allows the implementation of Industry 4.0 concepts in the telecom sector.<br><br>

 <H3>A. Telecommunicarion Risk</H3><br><br>
                          <h5>Ineffective digital growth and diversification strategy</h5><br>

Industry surveys confirm that digital services are the top priority for telco leaders. As 5G and the IoT move to center stage, telcos need to maximize their addressable market by developing innovative business models, and seizing opportunities for inorganic growth, service innovation and diversification through M&A and strategic alliances. 
<br><br>

<h5>Underestimating changing imperatives in privacy, security, and trust</h5><br>

Consumers’ concerns about the use of their online data are continuing to increase. Consumers and enterprises having digital trust now, telcos face the growing challenge of ensuring that their customers’ data and experiences are safe and secure. <br><br>

<h5>Inability to scale internal digitization initiatives</h5><br>

In their push to transform the customer experience, generate new efficiencies and boost organizational agility, many operators are launching multiyear digital transformation programs. Yet EY research shows these projects face significant barriers — not least are the burden of legacy IT platforms and a lack of digital skills. <br><br>


<h5>Failure to prioritize workforce planning and design</h5>

The shortage of digital skills presents challenges in the telecom industry.  Digital transformation programs tend to focus more on overhauling systems and processes than reshaping workforce capability. According to EY, to overcome these issues, telcos must take a holistic approach to workforce design. Building employee engagement is especially vital since this provides the foundation for a superior customer experience.<br><br>


<h5>Inability to combat the growing CAPEX burden</h5><br>

Operators across the world are facing a new wave of network investment, ranging from 5G and low-power wide area networks to gigabit fiber. As operators grapple with an ever more diverse portfolio of network assets, making the right choices around infrastructure switch-off, spin-off and sharing will become increasingly vital.<br><br>


<h5>Failure to navigate evolving disruption scenarios</h5><br>

Rising demand for intelligent connectivity is providing a wide range of powerful disruptors to the telecom industry. As the move to 5G gains momentum, operators need to stay alert to potentially disruptive threats and ensure that tackling them remains a top-of-mind priority. <br><br>

<h5>Inadequate portfolio management processes</h5>

Industry studies suggest that half of all operators fail to achieve the synergies initially targeted from their M&A deals, with inadequate integration planning and management processes often to blame. As convergence sees the differences between buyers and sellers widen, more transformational M&A may increase the challenges of integration, demanding more flexible integration road maps and smarter management of telcos’ business portfolios.<br><br>

<h5>Failure to adapt to changing regulatory frameworks</h5><br>

As regulators’ focus continues to shift toward areas such as data protection, wholesale pricing and interconnection are easing. Telecoms is increasingly finding itself at the heart of governments’ industrial policies, creating new demands on operators. According to EY, it’s important for them to map out, balance and navigate this changing landscape of national and international regulation and policy. <br><br>


<h5>Insufficient engagement with industry verticals and public sector</h5><br>

Telecoms is increasingly viewed as an enabler of digital transformation among private sector enterprises across many vertical industries. These factors point to a need for telcos to engage proactively with both the public sector and different industries — but to date, the level of engagement has remained limited. Telcos will position themselves to lead the emergence of new ecosystems and play their full role in transforming industries and society. <br><br>

<h5>Failure to integrate multiple routes to innovation</h5>

In recent decades, operators have outsourced much of their R&D. And operators’ R&D as a proportion is small relative to other industries, underlining how much innovation leadership is now in the hands of other players in the value chain. More recently, operators have taken steps to widen their sources of innovation, by launching new venture capital funds and incubator initiatives.<br><br><br>




                         <H3>B. Telecommunicarion Challenges</H3>

                          For the purpose of illuminating significant themes and questions for the present and future regulatory management of the ICT sector in Nigeria, the sub-theme of this paper is an examination of selected challenges affecting ICT delivery in the country.

						<h5>Consumer protection</h5><br>

						The protection of ICT consumers has posed a major challenge to ICT regulation in Nigeria. This problem has been compounded by the continuous impact of convergence in the ICT environment. Presently, various regulatory frameworks for ICT in Nigeria have not created adequate measures to ensure synergy and create an enabling environment for the adequate protection of consumers. In this regard, it should be noted that the Consumer Affairs Bureau (CAB)68 of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has not painstakingly remedied the complaints of telecommunications consumers in the face of convergence. Given this state of affairs, it is necessary to ensure the existence of appropriate consumer protection mechanisms in a converged ICT environment.69

						
<br><br>
						<h5>Computer-generated documentary evidence</h5><br>
						

						In 2011 a new Evidence Act was enacted to authorize the admissibility of "statements contained in a document produced by a computer ... as evidence".<br><br>

						The fact that computer-generated documents were previously inadmissible had made life difficult for the courts, and had created situations that undermined the activities of government as well as private individuals in Nigeria.71 For instance, the Nigerian contract laws required that a contract should be oral or in writing, and never contemplated the formation of electronic contracts.72 Under the new regime, however, documents in electronic formats containing electronic signatures as verification, for instance, will freely be processed, thus closing the earlier legal vacuum.73 The earlier judicial interpretations74 on the admissibility of electronic documents created juridical confusion as there were conflicting decisions across various courts in the land, including the Supreme Court. Some confusion may still occur in the interpretation of "computer" and "equipment" to include mobile phones for the purposes of admissibility.75 Construed purposefully, it is should not be difficult to recognise that mobile phones are considered within the contemplation of the Evidence Act of 2011.

						<h5>The centrality of telecommunications/ICTservices</h5><br>
						

						A major challenges to the ICT system in Nigeria include a dearth of expertise, the regulatory authorities' unwillingness to engage indigenous experts when they are available, and the poor construction and unsatisfactory implementation of sector-specific (eg telecommunications) laws. These challenges result from interpreting the regulations through a narrow lens, a practice that is far removed from the fundamental principles that underlie the provision of telecommunications services.76 For the purposes of leapfrogging development in transition economies such as Nigeria, the implementation of the principles of affordability, availability and accessibility has been considered crucial. Though service providers are primarily accountable for access to, the availability of and the affordability of telecommunications services, nonetheless the government is still under a statutory obligation to the guarantee integrity of the ICT legal environment and processes.

						<br><br>

						<h5>Privacy concerns</h5><br>
						

						The huge possibilities and benefits that accompany ICT deployment and indeed, convergence, have been obscured by an indifference to appropriate regulation on privacy. ICT in Nigeria is developing without a legal framework to protect the privacy of individuals in this rapidly evolving ICT environment. This was recently evident in the confusion that attended the telecommunications providers' (and later, the government's) attempts to capture subscribers' data during the SIM registration exercise. The confusion that attended the exercise would be largely traced to the lack of a framework - authorisations, a database, locations, guidelines and procedures relating to the capturing, storage and retrieval of data. Given the many negative uses to which data can be applied, it is necessary to develop a credible regime for the management and regulation of access to the personal data obtained from telecommunications subscribers. In this regard it should be noted that Nigeria presently lacks a data protection law. Data77 protection refers to the protection of the privacy of personal data or information relating to any identifiable individual from all forms of threats and abuses;78 such as unauthorised destruction, accidental loss and unauthorized access, alteration or dissemination of data.79

						<br><br>

						<h5>The quality of services (QoS)</h5><br>


						The poor quality of telecommunications services has been one of the major challenges to the ICT system in Nigeria. One of the causes of this problem has been the poor quality, insufficiency and inefficiency of the basic infrastructure that supports the operation of ICT networks and equipment in Nigeria. For example, it is common knowledge that the electrical power supply in Nigeria is highly erratic, and this renders ICT networks unreliable due to the occurrence of regular power outages and interruptions, and expensive due to having to cover the resulting costs of maintaining ICT infrastructure and equipment in Nigeria. It is doubtful if indifference and harmless threats would provide a remedy to users of the services.
<br><br>

						<h5>Broadband deployment</h5><br>

						 

						The deployment of broadband infrastructure has been slow in most developing countries, including Nigeria. This has been caused largely by the absence of adequate funding for such initiatives, as well by government insincerity. It had created the USPF to pursue the initiative and to deal with the cost implications of ensuring high speed applicable services.
<br><br>

						<h5>E-commerce and internet banking</h5><br>
						

						E-commerce has to do with commercial transactions that take place electronically or by means of an electronic data interchange.81 On the other hand, internet banking refers to the use of internet technologies in bank transactions. In this form of banking, customers access their accounts and general information on bank products and services through computers, mobile phones or other intelligent devices82 after establishing a connection with the bank's computer system over the internet. Internet banking is a form of E-commerce. Presently in Nigeria e-commerce and internet banking have not been fully developed. Consequently, a limited range of e-commerce and banking services are offered through the internet in Nigeria.83

<br><br>


The centre of global development is always shifting, and if the past few years are any indication, it is now swiftly shifting toward the African continent. Ghana, Nigeria, Botswana, Ethiopia, and other African countries have shown tremendous growth in recent years, with advances in everything from manufacturing and education to renewable energy. If these countries are to sustain that growth over the long term, however, their businesses must have access to quality telecommunications services. The following telecom companies are filling this vital need. Ranked in order of annual revenue, these firms provide the resources necessary for businesses, non-profits, and government agencies across the African continent to coordinate their activities and achieve sustained growth.<br><br>

10. 9Mobile<br><br>

As one of Nigeria’s leading telecommunications providers, 9Mobile offers 4G data plans, voice calls, digital content, and business phone services. The company currently has roughly 20mn subscribers, generating an annual revenue stream of $637mn. Besides supplying fast and reliable services, 9Mobile distinguishes itself with its extensive corporate social efforts, which include combating malaria, promoting care for those with HIV, providing career counselling, and contributing to Ebola containment efforts. It also seeks to minimize the environmental impact of its services, notably by designing eco-friendly SIM cards for mobile customers.<br><br>
